Hihi. Welcome to my GitHub. It's a mess I know. There might be some useful things here is you look hard enough.

Despite the profile, my name is B, and I'm currently a student studying computer science. I have a specific interest in customisation, using code to make life easier, using code to waste time, and AI.

The most interesting, and in all hoesty useful, thing I've written is [fck](https://github.com/fck-language/fck). It's the first coding language that can be used in multiple human languages! It's got a few other pretty cool features as well like trying to fix errors itself s you don't have to deal with them.

Anyway, enjoy life and have fun darling xx
