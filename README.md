Hej

Despite the profile, my name is nxe (pronounced nix) or B. I study computers because I can and you can't stop me, and write a lot from scratch because I can and you can't stop me.

I've written a [custom coding language](https://github.com/fck-language/fck) using some fun interesting concepts from automata theory to make things go fast and to enable the language to run with any set of keywords you want, so a multi-lingual programming language. Does it currently work? No. Am I working on it? Yes.

Okay bye
