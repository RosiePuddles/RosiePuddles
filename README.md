### nxe (they/she) 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Hihi. Welcome to my GitHub. It's a mess I know. There might be some useful things here is you look hard enough.

Despite the profile, my name is nxe (pronounced nix) or B. I'm currently a student studying computer science, I'll never tell you where. I spend too much of my time writing esolangs for very specific purposes, customising things to an obnoxious degree, or not getting enough sleep.

The most interesting, and in all hoesty useful, thing I've written is [fck](https://github.com/fck-language/fck). It's the first coding language that can be used in multiple human languages! It's got a few other pretty cool features as well like trying to fix errors itself so you don't have to deal with them.

Anyway, enjoy life and have fun darling xx
