Hihi. Welcome to my GitHub. It's a mess I know. There might be some useful things here is you look hard enough.

Despite the profile, my name is B, and I'm currently a student studying computer science. I have a specific interest in customisation, using code to make life easier, using code to waste time, and writing different coding languages for various reasons.

The most interesting, and in all hoesty useful, thing I've written is [fck](https://github.com/fck-language/fck). It's the first coding language that can be used in multiple human languages! It's got a few other pretty cool features as well like trying to fix errors itself so you don't have to deal with them.

Anyway, enjoy life and have fun darling xx

If you want to torture yourself you masochist, try coding in multiple dimensions. I got bored and made an n-dimensional esolang basically. Go do a thing
