Hihi. Welcome to my GitHub. It's a mess I know. There might be some useful things here is you look hard enough.
The most fun thing to take a look at is [fck](https://github.com/RosiePuddles/fck). It's a compiled and interpereted language which is nice and fancy I think. Anyway, enjoy life and have fun darling xx
